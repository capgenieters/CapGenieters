# Branches
All branches should follow the following naming conventions:

- No capital letters should be used
- Use normal dashes for spaces (no underscores)
- Avoid prepositions at all cost. (Eg. the, on, under, etc.)
- Prevent using words like fixing, implementing, improving, etc.
- Make the names as short as possible while providing the most clarity.

And the following structure:
- Start the name with the issue. (Eg. cap10)
- Follow up with the type of issue. (Eg. bug, feature, etc.)
- Describe the issue in one to three words. (Eg. lego-building-system)

Some examples:
- cap105-bug-audio-volume-glitch
- cap84-feature-spacial-sound
